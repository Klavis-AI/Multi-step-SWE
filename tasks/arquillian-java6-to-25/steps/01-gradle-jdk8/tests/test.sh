# One corroboration run of one inherited test class, classified from JUnit's own
# last word instead of from any string that happens to appear in the capture.
# The test class shares stdout with the runner, so a substring search over the
# whole file is answerable by the candidate: `grep initializationError` and
# `grep '^OK ('` were both satisfied by one println in the body of the single
# case being laundered, which took that class out of the comparison and scored a
# tree with a genuinely failing test 1.000000 -- measured, each on its own
# (ctlD2, ctlD3). JUnitCore prints exactly one terminal line, after every test in
# the class has run -- `OK (n tests)` or `Tests run: N,  Failures: M` -- and
# exits 0 for the first and non-zero for the second. So the verdict is the LAST
# such line and the exit status has to agree with it; a line printed from inside
# a test is neither last nor agreed with.
#
# Echoes one word, and a test count for the outcomes that carry one:
#   pass <n>      JUnit ended green and the JVM agreed
#   fail <n>      JUnit ended red, and <headers file> names the methods it blamed
#   classfail <n> red, with no method named in any header: a @BeforeClass or a
#                 static initialiser threw, so the class itself did not pass
#   notloadable   JUnit's only failure is this class's own initializationError --

# this step migrates a build system, it does not write Java -- so the set of
# top-level classes they compile to is known, recorded once against the pinned

# whatever compiled-output root the candidate's build chose
# (impl-base/build/classes/java/main/org/jboss/.../Foo.class is
# org.jboss.....Foo) and a renamed module directory changes nothing.
#
# The path carve-outs this replaces were load-bearing in both directions and
# wrong in both. Excluding nothing swept in classes that are not the library --
# a buildSrc convention plugin compiles at Gradle's own JVM default, and B-4
# reads a second major version and scores 0 on a tree whose library jars are
# all major 50. Excluding ./.gradle/* was the necessary inverse, because the
# wrapper cache holds third-party classes -- and it was also a hiding place:
# an inherited class compiled to the wrong major and dropped there fell out of
# the mirror entirely. Identity decides both: the buildSrc class is not in the
# list and is ignored wherever it sits, the inherited class is in the list and
# is found wherever it sits, so there is no directory left to hide in.
#
# Mirrored into one scratch root rather than passed as a file list: xargs
# splits a long list across several commands, and each would rewrite the output

   # measurement: a `test` task can be written to emit a green report for a case
   # that failed or never ran, and the reader above counts it as a pass. So the
   # scorer runs a set of the inherited test classes itself -- its own JVM, its
   # own classpath, its own parse of the output -- and compares the two.

   # Only one direction of disagreement is charged. A case the scorer's own run
   # FAILED while the report calls it passed is a CONTRADICTION: one of the two
   # is fabricated, and the report is the one the candidate wrote. The other
   # direction is not evidence of anything -- a report that admits a failure is
   # already counted by newfail, and a case that fails there and passes here is
   # the flakiness the order-dependent test documents.
