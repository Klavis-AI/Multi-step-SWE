# Step 03 -- 03-java7. Scored per authoring/checklists/step03.md.
# SCORED AS A PRODUCT SINCE 2026-10-13: reward = T1 x T2, where T1 is this
# step's own migrated-ness family and T2 the preservation families; the
# weights named below are now relative weights inside those two factors, and
# any floor arithmetic below is superseded. The formula is at the foot.
#
# Three weights, two families (rule 5):
#
#   A  0.30  behaviour equivalence -- the same 935 recorded fixtures, replayed
#            against the artifacts the candidate's build publishes. A language
#            level migration must not change what the code does, and four of
#            those 935 are the reason the golden solution leaves two allocations
#            in java.io: see baseline/nioids.txt.
#   B  0.70 x 0.25  everything steps 01 and 02 established, re-measured. Seven
#            gates inherited from step 01 -- one of which, B-4, is RETARGETED
#            here from class-file major 50 to 51 and is this step's must-flip --
#            plus two that hold step 02's JUnit 5 migration in place.
#   C  0.70 x 0.75  the tree is Java 7 -- diamond, try-with-resources and
#            java.nio.file, read off the typed AST by arqgate.SourceScan, with
#            javac's own acceptance of the tree at two language levels as an
#            independent second channel.
#
# Why family B is nine gates and not step 02's seven-plus-a-whole-family. Step
# 02 carried its predecessor forward as family B and scored its own work as
# family C; done again at every rung, step 13's verifier would carry twelve
# families. What actually has to hold from step 02 is that the suite is still a
# Jupiter suite and still free of JUnit 4 -- B-8 and B-9, lifted verbatim from
# step 02's C-1 and C-2. Step 02's C-3, C-4 and C-5 grade HOW that migration was
# done (which named sites became assertThrows, which @RunWith classes moved,
# how many assertion calls survived), and none of them can regress without B-8
# or B-9 regressing first. Step 02's C-6 asked whether the Jupiter classes were
# still major 50; at this step that question is B-4's, retargeted, and it is a
# must-flip rather than an inherited free pass. Logged in NOTES 8.5.
#
# Every gate is defensive: a gate that cannot run scores 0 and says why, and
# the script always reaches report() (rule 8).

# the run printed, and the XML the platform's own listener wrote into a
# directory the SCORER chose.
#
# Step 01 had one channel -- JUnitCore's last line -- and layered
# arqgate.SelfStop underneath it, because a test that ends the JVM can print
# whatever tail it likes first. Measured here, on this harness: a class whose
# single case prints
#
#     Test run finished after 1 ms
#     [         1 tests found           ]
#     [         0 tests failed          ]
#
# and then calls Runtime.halt(0) exits 0 and satisfies a tail-of-stdout parse
# completely. That is step 01's ctlD7 wearing this harness's costume.
#
# --reports-dir is what makes it cheap to refuse. The engine's XML is flushed
# after the engine finishes, so a JVM that leaves early never writes it: the
# halt above produces TEST-junit-platform-suite.xml and no TEST-junit-jupiter.xml
# at all, while every honest run writes both. So the verdict requires a
# <testcase> for this class in an ENGINE report, and requires its count to
# agree with the summary the run printed. SelfStop still runs underneath, for
# the tree that writes the reports and then halts.
#
# Echoes one word, and a case count for the outcomes that carry one:
#   pass <n>      every case green, on both channels, and the JVM agreed
#   fail <n>      at least one case red; <headers file> names them
#   classfail <n> a container failed -- @BeforeAll or a class-level extension

# Selected by CLASS IDENTITY, not by path. The inherited sources are fixed --
# this step migrates a build system, it does not write Java -- so the set of
# top-level classes they compile to is known, recorded once against the pinned
# tree, and shipped as baseline/classnames.txt. A tree .class file is mirrored
# if and only if its fully-qualified name, with any $-suffix stripped, is in

# whatever compiled-output root the candidate's build chose
# (impl-base/build/classes/java/main/org/jboss/.../Foo.class is
# org.jboss.....Foo) and a renamed module directory changes nothing.
#
# The path carve-outs this replaces were load-bearing in both directions and
# wrong in both. Excluding nothing swept in classes that are not the library --
# a buildSrc convention plugin compiles at Gradle's own JVM default, and B-4
# reads a second major version and scores 0 on a tree whose library jars are
# all major 50. Excluding ./.gradle/* was the necessary inverse, because the
# wrapper cache holds third-party classes -- and it was also a hiding place:
# an inherited class compiled to the wrong major and dropped there fell out of
# the mirror entirely. Identity decides both: the buildSrc class is not in the
# list and is ignored wherever it sits, the inherited class is in the list and
# is found wherever it sits, so there is no directory left to hide in.
#
# Mirrored into one scratch root rather than passed as a file list: xargs
# splits a long list across several commands, and each would rewrite the output
# file, so a gate would silently report only the last batch. One root is one
# invocation whatever the tree's size. The matching is one gawk process over

   # that failed or never ran, and the reader above counts it as a pass. So the
   # scorer runs a set of the inherited test classes itself -- its own JVM, its
   # own classpath, its own parse of the output -- and compares the two.

   # Only one direction of disagreement is charged. A case the scorer's own run
   # FAILED while the report calls it passed is a CONTRADICTION: one of the two
   # is fabricated, and the report is the one the candidate wrote. The other

#
# Step 02 moved this suite from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5. A step that migrates the
# language level has no business touching that, and a step that lets it be
# undone has not held its predecessor's ground -- so the two gates that say the
# migration is still there are inherited whole, as B-8 and B-9. They are step
# 02's C-1 and C-2, lifted verbatim including their comments, because a
# re-derivation of a reviewed gate is a new gate.
#
# Its C-3, C-4 and C-5 are NOT carried forward. They grade how step 02 was done
# -- which of nineteen named @Test(expected=) sites became assertThrows, which
# sixteen @RunWith classes moved, how many assertion calls survived the move --
# and none of them can regress without B-8 or B-9 regressing first: a class that
# stops being a pure Jupiter test fails B-8, and one that names org.junit again
# fails B-9. Its C-6 asked whether the migrated classes were still major 50;
# here that question belongs to B-4 at 51, where it is a must-flip. NOTES 8.5.
#
# Scope. Both gates are restricted to the MUST-MIGRATE set: the 55 test classes
# the frozen 2011 run recorded, minus the six in baseline/compat.txt. Those six
# are about JUnit 4 rather than merely written in it -- they construct
# org.junit.runner.Runner instances, hand them fixture classes and assert on the
# Result that comes back -- so a gate that charged them for naming a retired type
# would be asking the candidate to delete the thing under test. 55 - 6 = 49, and
# both numbers come from the scorer's own baseline rather than from anything the
# tree can move.
#
# The mirror and the module jars, exactly as B-4 and B-5 read them: the mirror is
# the tree's own compiled output filtered to the frozen class names, so a
# third-party jar unpacked into the tree cannot answer for it.

   # step -- which is not an incentive, it is a rounding error. So the four are

   # the construct and broke the behaviour halves this gate. The requirement in

   # being scored rather than implied.
   #
   # The arrival half reads ref + staticref, not ref alone. `niofile.ref` counts
   # member selects whose qualifier IS a java.nio.file type -- `Paths.get`,
   # `Files.exists` -- which is how the golden solution writes every one of its
   # 13, and so is what the frozen target measures. It is not the only correct
   # spelling: `import static java.nio.file.Files.exists;` leaves `exists(p)`,
   # with no qualifier for that counter to read, and a tree that migrated every
   # site that way would have scored an arrival of 0. `niofile.staticref` counts
   # those by the called method's OWNER instead, is 0 on the golden, and so
   # changes no frozen figure -- it exists so that a correct migration spelled
   # differently is not scored as a migration that did not happen.
   #
   # The denominator is the 11 sites that move, which is the same 11 the
   # departure half divides by, and not the golden's own 13 references. Those
   # are not the same number and the difference is not cosmetic: 13 is how many
   # qualified NIO.2 references the golden solution happened to write for 11
   # moved sites, so a migration that moved all 11 and reached them in 11
   # references -- one apiece, no `Files.exists` guard the golden chose to add
   # -- would have read 0.846 for work that is complete. A denominator taken
   # from one correct tree's spelling scores spelling. 11 is the requirement,
   # stated as such in the instruction, and the golden clamps to 1 with margin.
   #

   # compile at -source 1.6, and every error in the 1.6 run must be a
   # language-level error rather than something else that happens to fail.
   #
   # This is the gate no AST counter can stand in for. A tree can carry
   # diamonds and resource clauses in files the build never compiles, or carry
   # them and still declare 1.6 so that its own build is broken; javac's answer
   # at each level is about the tree as a whole. It is also the gate that
   # separates this step from its predecessor most cleanly: the step-02 tree
   # compiles at BOTH levels -- measured -- and therefore scores 0 here while
   # every "is it absent" half above it reads perfectly.
   #
   # The flip itself is cheap on purpose and cheap to game for the same reason:
   # ONE diamond, anywhere javac reaches, plus 1.7 in the build files, is enough
   # to make ok17=yes and ok16=no with every 1.6 error a language-level one.
   # Binary, that would hand the whole 0.15 to a tree that had been edited in
   # two places, and C-4 sits on the far side of the A/B split where such a tree
   # already collects B-4. So the flip is scaled by how far past 1.6 the tree
   # actually went, measured the only way this gate measures anything: the
   # number of errors javac raises when told to read the tree as Java 6.
   #
   # The denominator is 20 and the golden tree raises 55, so it is not a second
   # count of C-1's 93 conversions by another name -- it is a floor under
   # "broadly", set well below the golden so that a migration which spells the
   # same work differently, or reaches it in fewer files, still reads 1.000000.

# is required to change nothing that a caller can observe.
#
# The floor is arithmetic, not hope. The step-02 golden tree under this scorer
# scores family A in full and eight of nine B gates in full -- everything it
# won is still won -- and fails B-4, because its class files are major 50 and
# this rung's are 51. Family C reads zero on it: no diamond, no resource
# clause, no java.nio.file, and it compiles at -source 1.6, so C-4's must-flip

# against migration_prompt item 6's requirement of 0.5 or under. The margin is

# unmigrated tree -- which has no raw types and no added suppressions, having
# added nothing -- so any weight w it took inside family C would add 0.525*w
# straight to the floor: 0.4995 at w = 0.10, and 0.5258 at w = 0.15, which is
# item 6's requirement failed outright. A term that pays a tree for not having
