# Step 02 -- 02-junit5-testing. Scored per authoring/checklists/step02.md.
# SCORED AS A PRODUCT SINCE 2026-10-13: reward = T1 x T2, where T1 is this
# step's own migrated-ness family and T2 the preservation families; the
# weights named below are now relative weights inside those two factors, and
# any floor arithmetic below is superseded. The formula is at the foot.
#
# Three families (rule 5):
#
#   A  0.30  behaviour equivalence -- the same 935 recorded fixtures, replayed
#            against the artifacts the candidate's build publishes. This step
#            does not touch main code, so A is a REGRESSION family here: it is
#            worth less than at step 01 because passing it is the absence of
#            damage rather than the presence of work.
#   B  0.70 x 0.25  everything step 01 established, re-measured. A step that
#            quietly undoes its predecessor has not migrated anything.
#   C  0.70 x 0.75  the test framework actually moved -- six properties read
#            out of compiled class files by arqgate.Junit5.
#
# Family A is deliberately unable to distinguish this step's tree from step
# 01's: the published artifacts are byte-identical, because only test sources
# changed. That overlap is logged in NOTES-authoring.md section 7.5 and is the
# reason A carries 0.30 rather than 0.50 -- see the floor calculation there,
# which is what fixes these three weights.
#
# Every gate is defensive: a gate that cannot run scores 0 and says why, and
# the script always reaches report() (rule 8).

# One corroboration run of one inherited test class under the JUnit Platform,
# classified from two channels that have to agree: the ConsoleLauncher summary
# the run printed, and the XML the platform's own listener wrote into a
# directory the SCORER chose.
#
# Step 01 had one channel -- JUnitCore's last line -- and layered
# arqgate.SelfStop underneath it, because a test that ends the JVM can print
# whatever tail it likes first. Measured here, on this harness: a class whose
# single case prints
#
#     Test run finished after 1 ms
#     [         1 tests found           ]
#     [         0 tests failed          ]
#
# and then calls Runtime.halt(0) exits 0 and satisfies a tail-of-stdout parse
# completely. That is step 01's ctlD7 wearing this harness's costume.
#
# --reports-dir is what makes it cheap to refuse. The engine's XML is flushed
# after the engine finishes, so a JVM that leaves early never writes it: the
# halt above produces TEST-junit-platform-suite.xml and no TEST-junit-jupiter.xml
# at all, while every honest run writes both. So the verdict requires a
# <testcase> for this class in an ENGINE report, and requires its count to
# agree with the summary the run printed. SelfStop still runs underneath, for
# the tree that writes the reports and then halts.
#
# Echoes one word, and a case count for the outcomes that carry one:
#   pass <n>      every case green, on both channels, and the JVM agreed
#   fail <n>      at least one case red; <headers file> names them
#   classfail <n> a container failed -- @BeforeAll or a class-level extension
#   notloadable   discovery found nothing to run here: rc=2. A class with no
#                 runnable methods, or one this tree no longer has.

# The project's own compiled classes, wherever in the tree they ended up,
# mirrored once: B-4 reads them for class-file versions and B-5 for the test
# population.
#
# Selected by CLASS IDENTITY, not by path. The inherited sources are fixed --
# this step migrates a build system, it does not write Java -- so the set of
# top-level classes they compile to is known, recorded once against the pinned
# tree, and shipped as baseline/classnames.txt. A tree .class file is mirrored
# if and only if its fully-qualified name, with any $-suffix stripped, is in
# that list: matched on the path SUFFIX, so the name is read from below
# whatever compiled-output root the candidate's build chose
# (impl-base/build/classes/java/main/org/jboss/.../Foo.class is
# org.jboss.....Foo) and a renamed module directory changes nothing.
#
# The path carve-outs this replaces were load-bearing in both directions and
# wrong in both. Excluding nothing swept in classes that are not the library --
# a buildSrc convention plugin compiles at Gradle's own JVM default, and B-4
# reads a second major version and scores 0 on a tree whose library jars are
# all major 50. Excluding ./.gradle/* was the necessary inverse, because the
# wrapper cache holds third-party classes -- and it was also a hiding place:
# an inherited class compiled to the wrong major and dropped there fell out of
# the mirror entirely. Identity decides both: the buildSrc class is not in the
# list and is ignored wherever it sits, the inherited class is in the list and
# is found wherever it sits, so there is no directory left to hide in.
#
# Mirrored into one scratch root rather than passed as a file list: xargs
# splits a long list across several commands, and each would rewrite the output
# file, so a gate would silently report only the last batch. One root is one
# invocation whatever the tree's size. The matching is one gawk process over
# the whole find, not one test per file.

   # own classpath, its own parse of the output -- and compares the two.

   # System.load/loadLibrary, since a native library can call _exit where no
   # Java-side scan would see it. The reflective route is a conjunction: the

   # Lookup.find*), a stop member name as a constant, AND the owner. The owner
   # half is read three ways -- as a Utf8 (`"java.lang.Runtime"`), as a Type or

   # (`Runtime.getRuntime()`). None of the three is ever a hit on its own.

#
# The migration this step actually asks for, read out of compiled class files by
# arqgate.Junit5 -- constant pool, annotation tables and invoke sites, never
# source text (rule 11). Family B above is inherited whole from step 01 and says
# nothing about JUnit 5: a tree can satisfy every one of its seven gates while
# still being a JUnit 4 suite, which is exactly what the floor run demonstrates.
# So the new requirement is scored here, and carries three quarters of family B's
# weight.
#
# Scope. Every gate below is restricted to the MUST-MIGRATE set: the 55 test
# classes the frozen 2011 run recorded, minus the six in baseline/compat.txt.
# Those six are about JUnit 4 rather than merely written in it -- they construct
# org.junit.runner.Runner instances, hand them fixture classes and assert on the
# Result that comes back -- so a gate that charged them for naming a retired type
# would be asking the candidate to delete the thing under test. The exemption is
# from C-2 alone in spirit; in practice it is applied to the whole block, because
# a class whose job is to drive JUnit 4 has no business being counted as an
# unmigrated Jupiter test either. 55 - 6 = 49, and both numbers come from the
# scorer's own baseline rather than from anything the tree can move.
#
# The mirror and the module jars, exactly as B-4 and B-5 read them: the mirror is
# the tree's own compiled output filtered to the frozen class names, so a
# third-party jar unpacked into the tree cannot answer for it.
