# PROFILE — what this task covers, and what it does not

This file is the same at every step except for the last section. It defines the
product. `TEST_INTERFACE.md` defines how the product is graded; the manual
pages in this directory define how it must behave.

## The product

A **PCRE2 regular-expression engine**: a C library that compiles a pattern into
an internal form and matches it against a subject, plus the `pcre2test` driver
that exercises it. The task is not "a regex engine of your own design" — it is
*this* engine, at a specific published release, observable through `pcre2test`.

Thirteen steps walk a single workspace forward along thirteen real PCRE2
releases, from 10.20 (2015) to 10.48 (2026). Each step names one release. The
milestone of a step is the behaviour that release introduced relative to the
previous step's release, and nothing else.

## In scope

* The pattern compiler: syntax, escapes, classes, quantifiers, groups,
  assertions, conditions, backreferences, subroutine calls, recursion, verbs,
  options and their interactions, and the compile-time diagnostics — error
  numbers, error messages and error offsets — exactly as documented.
* The interpreting matcher (`pcre2_match()`), including its backtracking model,
  its limits, and how they are reported.
* The alternative DFA matcher (`pcre2_dfa_match()`).
* The Unicode layer: properties, scripts, case folding, `\X`, UTF validity
  checking, and UTF and UCP mode in all three widths.
* The surrounding API: match data, substring extraction, `pcre2_substitute()`,
  pattern information, serialization, callouts, the POSIX wrapper, and the
  configuration query — to the extent `pcre2test` can reach them.
* All three code-unit widths: 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit, from one source tree.
* `pcre2test` itself, from step 2 onward: it is supplied working at step 1, and
  keeping it compiling and printing correctly as the library changes is part of
  the work from then on.

## Out of scope at every step

* **The JIT compiler in its entirety**, and the `sljit` backend under it.
  `SUPPORT_JIT` is never defined; the build must not require `sljit`, which
  from release 10.45 is not even in the upstream repository. `pcre2test -C`
  must report that JIT is unavailable.
* `pcre2grep` and its fixtures.
* The fuzzer harness.
* EBCDIC, z/OS and Windows configurations.
* The maintainer utilities: generating the Unicode tables, the chartables or
  the manual pages from their sources. Every generated artefact this engine
  needs is supplied to you as data.
* Build-system portability. There is exactly one supported build — `make` in
  `/app`, producing `/app/build/pcre2test` — and one supported platform, the
  container you are in. No autotools, no CMake, no cross-compilation, no shared
  libraries, no installation.
* Performance. Nothing is timed beyond the per-case timeout, and nothing is
  measured in allocations or instructions.

## How the thirteen steps run

| Step | Release | Subject |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 10.20 | The recursive engine |
| 2 | 10.22 | A cycle broken and a POSIX option stops implying another |
| 3 | 10.23 | The compile-path restructure |
| 4 | 10.30 | The heap-frame engine |
| 5 | 10.32 | De-recursing the DFA and persisting extra options |
| 6 | 10.33 | Script runs |
| 7 | 10.34 | Invalid UTF and non-atomic lookarounds |
| 8 | 10.39 | The atomicity withdrawal and the `\K` story |
| 9 | 10.42 | Script properties and the silent redefinition |
| 10 | 10.43 | Variable-length lookbehind and four class redefinitions |
| 11 | 10.45 | Limits, optimisation control, extended classes |
| 12 | 10.47 | Iteration and a security fix |
| 13 | 10.48 | Unicode 17 and the harness rewrite |

A step's documentation is *its own release's* documentation. It describes that
release's behaviour and no later release's. Where your recollection of PCRE2
disagrees with the manual page in this directory, the manual page is right and
your recollection is about a different release — several constructs in this
ladder mean one thing early and something else later, and reproducing the
modern meaning early is a scored failure, not a rounding error.

## Where you are

This is step 05 of 13, at PCRE2 10.32, which also absorbs the 10.31 release.
Step 04 left a 10.30 tree whose interpreting matcher runs on heap frames and
whose compile context carries a second, extra option word that is thrown away
once the pattern is compiled. This step de-recurses `pcre2_dfa_match()` so
the heap limit governs it too, stores the extra options with the compiled
pattern and reports them through `PCRE2_INFO_EXTRAOPTIONS`, adds
`\N{U+dddd}`, `(?^)` and arguments on `(*ACCEPT)`, `(*FAIL)` and `(*COMMIT)`,
and corrects two long-standing `pcre2test -C` answers. Step 06 assumes the
extra-options machinery is complete, because it adds three more members to it.

Because two upstream releases are collapsed into one step, the change entries
you are given carry two release headings, and item numbers restart under
the second: a citation is unambiguous only with its release. Against modern
PCRE2 this release still has no script runs, no alphabetic assertion names
and no substitution callouts, and its `info` output still uses the word
"subpattern" where modern PCRE2 says "capture group".
